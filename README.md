## Running the Project

### Personal Scenario Lessons in This Fork

The catalog now includes eight lessons, adding needs discovery and scheduling a meeting. Pair a Chinese meaning with your own English answer in the profile to personalize work and product lessons. Editing a personal answer gives the new sentence its own review schedule. The progress page lets you expand older expressions and see daily listening assessments alongside speaking self-ratings.

The `feat/personal-scenarios` branch adds a beginner learning flow at `/scenarios`, accessible from the home page. See the [Chinese feature and fix notes](docs/README.zh-CN.md) for details.

- The first six lessons cover introductions, work, products, audiences, uses, and asking for clarification, with Chinese explanations, listening choices, typing, layered hints, and spoken self-assessment.
- Choose 10, 15, or 25 minutes. The longer plan adds a recall task and a different conversational setting. A quick option reviews two due cards.
- Use 35 bundled English audio samples, browser speech for personal names and custom sentences, and optional recording playback and retention.
- Listening and speaking have separate FSRS cards and progress statistics. Due review controls update automatically as time passes.
- Resume saved steps, drafts, hints, and listening choices. Explicit tab takeover restores the latest saved answer.
- Export scenario records with optional recordings, or include them in the existing full ZIP backup. Full local restores commit all modules together and roll back on write failure. Decompression enforces output limits.

Scenario data is stored in the current browser. Export a backup before switching devices or clearing browser data. Use recent Chrome or Edge for Web Locks support. Speaking results use self-assessment.

Fix commit `9c85e8c` passed 16 automated tests, a production build, and Chrome regression checks for takeover, listening recovery, due reviews, the longer lesson flow, and failed-restore rollback and retry. The full application type check still reports 66 errors.

Run `pnpm test` with Node.js 24, `pnpm build` to build, and `pnpm preview` to preview.

#### Note: This project can run standalone with data saved locally. Manual backup is required when switching devices; this does not affect normal usage.

This project is built with `Nuxt` and requires a Node.js environment.

1. Install NodeJS, refer to the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. To get this fork's personal learning version, use `git clone --depth 1 --branch feat/personal-scenarios https://github.com/ethanfongpu/TypeWords.git`.
3. In the project root directory, open a terminal and run `pnpm install` to download dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm run dev` to start the project. The default address is [`http://localhost:5567`](http://localhost:5567)
5. Open [`http://localhost:5567`](http://localhost:5567) in your browser to access the project.
6. Run `pnpm run generate` to build the project files.
